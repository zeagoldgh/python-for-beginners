Create a new Python script that prompts a user to enter in a potential Tweet and then print out whether the tweet is short enough to work (under 140 chars) or too long to post.

If the tweet is under 140 characters long, your script should output something like this:

enter your tweet: **hello twitter! Idk what to say here**

That 35 char tweet will work!
If the tweet is over 140 characters, your script should output something like this:

enter your tweet: **I'm sick and tired of people littering and leaving their garbage all over beautiful places! Why are so many people such unbelievable morons??????**

Your 145 char tweet is 5 chars too long
